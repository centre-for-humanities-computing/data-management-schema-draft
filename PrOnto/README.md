# PrOnto: Privacy Ontology for Legal Reasoning #

The `accessibility` key to access values from the PrOnto for the data set


## Data and Document ##

The data and the documents are documental sources; using the FRBR ontology, we model their representations over time by reusing a robust design pattern already adopted for the publication process.

The _Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Record_ (FRBR) is a general model, proposed by the International Federation of Library Association (IFLA), for describing documents and their evolution. It works for both physical and digital resources and it has proved to be very flexible and powerful. One of the most important aspects of FRBR is the fact that it is not associated with a particular metadata schema or implementation.


```json
"data": {
      "access": "public/private",
      "pseudonymized": "bool",
      "encrypted": "bool",
      "frbr-class": "Personal/NonPersonal",
      "frbr-data": "Judical/Sensitive/Anonymous/LegalPerson",
      "frbr-sensitive": "Heath/Ethnic/Genetic/Biometric/Sexual/Opnion"
    },
```
